# RSS getter

## A simple script to download torrent files from RSS feeds.

It exists because I could not make rssdler work well.

It enables downloading multiple feeds, filtering torrents by regexes.
* Required: A feed must match the required regex.
* Forbidden: A feed cannot match the forbidden regex

Yes, thats many, regexes are powerful

It works only on feeds that provide magnet links
